## :scroll: Project description
Have you ever wanted to get mentioned on Discord at a certain time? Maybe you even wanted to see a small note from your past self in there? That's what this code was written for!
(A small project made for my discord server as a fun way to learn MongoDB.)

## :hammer_and_wrench: Deployment

To self-host this project for free:
1. Create a new application on https://discord.com/developers/applications.
2. Create a new bot in the application.
3. Add the bot to a server and get the bot's token and the server's target bot channel's ID.
4. Create a free cluster on https://www.mongodb.com/ and get its log in link and password. Customize the link to the format given below.
5. Create a database and three collections inside it. First one is for future reminders, second one is for past reminders, third one is for user profiles.
6. Create a project on https://replit.com and connect it with your fork of this repository (or manually copy the files there).
7. Create replit environment variables described below and fill them with your values.
8. Run the code on replit and copy the link of the created website.
9. Create a new monitor on https://uptimerobot.com/ on the link of your aforementioned website. Keep the other parameters at default values.

🎇 Done! The bot is ready to use. 🎇

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face:

## :rocket: Additional features
Besides the commands behaviour, the bot also:

- validates message content,
- validates date and time of a reminder.


## :arrow_up: Room for improvement
- Automated live tests (dedicated bot for testing this one),
- some functions should be refactored into several new ones,
- generating a jpg of the incoming week with your reminders on it,
- interval reminders,
- parsing different formats of dates (dateutil.parser),
- reminding flashcards using the Leitner system,
- command for deleting all your reminders,
- add cooldown on all commands, not only on creating reminders,
- mentioning other users in advance.
